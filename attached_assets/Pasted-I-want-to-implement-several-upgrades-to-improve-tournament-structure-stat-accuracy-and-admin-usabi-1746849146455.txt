I want to implement several upgrades to improve tournament structure, stat accuracy, and admin usability in my volleyball stat tracking app. Please follow the changes and suggestions carefully:
 
🔢 1. 
Add 3 Sets Per Match
•	Each match should support up to 3 sets.
•	If one team wins both the first 2 sets, the 3rd set should not be played.
•	On the stat tracker UI:
o	Show active set number
o	Allow tracking stats per set
o	Allow admin to override or resume set 3 manually if needed
 
🧮 2. 
Update Stat Tracking Action Buttons
•	Remove: Dig from Earned
•	Add to Earned: Point (used when the team gets a point not tied to another specific action)
•	Add to Fault:
o	Out of Bounds
o	Fault (generic for things like touching net, illegal rotation)
 

📱 3. 
Improve Admin Edit/Delete/Save Button UX
•	On the admin panel (teams/schedule editing):
o	Either increase button size or
o	Reposition buttons to prevent accidental taps on tablets
o	Best approach: place Save as primary button (right-aligned), with larger hitbox (min 44px height)
o	Consider spacing out or using a 2-row layout for better mobile ergonomics
 
🔍 4. 
Add Player Search When Creating Teams
•	On the create/edit team page:
o	Add a search bar above the player list
o	Search should filter players by name (case-insensitive)
o	Allow clicking on the filtered result to add them to the team
o	Highlight already-added players
 
📊 5. 
Expandable Player Cards (Admin > Player Stats)
•	On the admin dashboard > player stats:
o	Each card should be expandable (on click)
o	Expanded view should show:
	Total stats: spikes, blocks, faults, serves, etc.
	Win/loss ratio
	Average performance per match
	Small graph (e.g., bar chart or radar) showing performance breakdown
•	Use collapsible animation and responsive layout
 
🏅 6. 
Public Leaderboard Page
•	Add /leaderboard page (public route, no login needed)
•	Rank players based on weighted performance metric:
o	Points = 3
o	Spikes = 2
o	Aces = 2
o	Blocks = 1.5
o	Deductions for faults = -1
•	Leaderboard should show:
o	Player name
o	Team
o	Total points (based on metric)
o	Games played
o	Optional: MVP badge for top player
•	Should be sortable by column (points, name, team)
 
🧠 7. 
Fix for Block Button in Stat Tracking
•	Currently, Block is in the “Earned” group, but it doesn’t always give a point
•	Instead:
o	When clicking Block, show a popup/modal:
	“Did the block result in a point?”
	If yes, record under Earned
	If no, record under Neutral
o	Update data model to support “Neutral” category if not already
 
📌 Suggested General Improvements
•	Add “Undo Last Action” button on stat tracking screen (within 10s)
•	Use keyboard shortcuts (or swipe gestures) on tablets for faster tracking
•	Allow exporting match stats (CSV or PDF) per team/player
•	Add a dark mode toggle for tracking in gym lighting conditions
