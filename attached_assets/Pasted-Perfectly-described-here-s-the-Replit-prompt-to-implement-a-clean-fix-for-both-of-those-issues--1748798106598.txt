Perfectly described — here’s the Replit prompt to implement a clean fix for both of those issues:

🔧 Prompt: Improve Set/Game Navigation Logic After Login or Page Refresh

🧩 Problem Summary:
	1.	When a set is completed and locked, and the user navigates away or logs out and back in:
	•	The app returns to the first set, even though it is locked.
	•	Users are forced to manually switch to the next available set — this causes confusion, especially if they can’t interact with the locked set.
	2.	Similarly, if the only available match is already locked, it still tries to return to it without any feedback — giving a false sense that something is wrong.

✅ Expected Behavior:

For Sets:
	•	After login or refresh, the app should automatically redirect the user to the next available (unlocked) set in that match.
	•	If all sets are locked → show a message like:
“All sets for this match have been finalized. Tracking is complete.”

For Matches:
	•	If the current match is already finalized and locked:
	•	Check for any other available match for that team, and redirect to it.
	•	If no other match is available, show:
“No available matches. All scheduled games for your team have been completed.”

🧠 Implementation Notes:

For Sets:
	•	On component load or login:

const firstAvailableSet = match.sets.find(set => set.status === 'available');
if (firstAvailableSet) {
  setCurrentSet(firstAvailableSet.number);
} else {
  setShowMatchComplete(true); // trigger a locked message state
}



For Matches:
	•	After login or when loading team’s matches:

const upcomingMatch = teamMatches.find(match => match.status !== 'locked');
if (upcomingMatch) {
  loadMatch(upcomingMatch.id);
} else {
  showNoMatchesMessage(); // UI for "All matches locked"
}

🧪 Testing Scenarios:
	•	Finalize Set 1 → refresh → should auto-land on Set 2
	•	Finalize all sets → logout/login → should show locked message
	•	Team has multiple matches → after finalizing current match, logout/login → should land on next available match
	•	Team has only one match, and it’s locked → show “Game is locked” message

Let me know if you want the messages to be styled a specific way or also shown on mobile as a toast or modal.
