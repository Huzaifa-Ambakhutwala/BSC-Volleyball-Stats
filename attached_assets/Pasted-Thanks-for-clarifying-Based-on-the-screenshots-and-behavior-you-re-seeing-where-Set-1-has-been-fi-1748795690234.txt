Thanks for clarifying. Based on the screenshots and behavior you’re seeing — where Set 1 has been finalized but Set 2 is still locked or stuck due to logic issues — here’s a precise Replit prompt you can give to your devs to debug and fix this:

🔧 Prompt: Fix Set Finalization Bug in Stat Tracker Module

We’re encountering a bug in the Stat Tracker module related to set finalization and state transitions.

🔍 Issue Description:
	1.	Set 1 is finalized, but Set 2 remains locked or shows “Set 1 needs to be finalized” even though it is.
	2.	Clicking on finalize for Set 2 sometimes throws an incorrect message: "Set 1 has already been finalized and cannot be modified" — even though the action is for Set 2.
	3.	In other cases, the UI doesn’t reflect the correct state and gets stuck on Set 1, blocking progression.

✅ Expected Behavior:
	•	Once Set 1 is finalized and locked, Set 2 should unlock and become available for tracking and finalization.
	•	Set state transitions should follow a strict logic:
	•	Set 1 → Set 2 → Set 3.
	•	Finalization button should trigger logic specifically for the currently active (and available) set, not always Set 1.
	•	UI and backend must stay in sync for:
	•	setStatus (locked/available/finalized)
	•	currentSet
	•	matchId, setNumber

🧪 Suggested Debug Steps:
	•	Check logic in backend/API where finalization happens — ensure it’s updating the correct set’s status.
	•	Ensure currentSet state in frontend is dynamically mapped to the set being finalized, not hardcoded.
	•	Confirm matchProgress state (or similar) properly updates unlocked status of the next set after current set is finalized.
	•	Inspect the guard conditions preventing access to next set — especially the ones checking if previous set is finalized.
	•	Test if the lockSet or finalizeSet functions are being called with correct setIndex or setId.

📍 Location to Check in Code:
	•	StatTrackerLogic.tsx or wherever set finalization buttons are handled.
	•	Any utility like getSetStatus, handleFinalizeSet, or mutation calls like updateSetStatus.

📌 Fix Checklist:
	•	Ensure correct set index is passed in finalization logic.
	•	Unlock next set after previous set is marked as “finalized”.
	•	Update UI state (tabs/buttons) based on latest set status from server.
	•	Add error boundary to show which set is actually failing, not always default to Set 1.
	•	Retest by finalizing Set 1 and then ensuring Set 2 is immediately available.
