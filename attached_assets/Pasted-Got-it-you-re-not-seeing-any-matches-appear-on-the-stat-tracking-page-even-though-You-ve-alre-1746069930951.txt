Got it — you’re not seeing any matches appear on the stat tracking page, even though:
	•	You’ve already created matches
	•	They’re assigned to specific courts/teams
	•	You expect stat trackers to see and select them

⸻

✅ Let’s Debug This Step-by-Step:

1. Is listenToMatchesByCourtNumber() or similar function being used in the stat tracker?

Check your stat tracking page. It should have something like:

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = listenToMatchesByCourtNumber(courtNumber, (matchesByCourtNumber) => {
    // Update local state with matches
  });
  return () => unsubscribe();
}, [courtNumber]);

Or if you’re not filtering by court and instead want all matches, it should use:

listenToAllMatches((matchList) => setMatches(matchList));

✅ If your stat trackers should see all matches, make sure you are not filtering by court ID unless needed.

2. Check Match Structure in Firebase

Open [Firebase Console → Realtime Database] and confirm:
	•	Matches exist under /matches/{matchID}
	•	Each match has fields like:
	•	courtNumber, teamA, teamB, startTime
	•	(Optional: status: "scheduled" or "in-progress")

✅ Make sure match data is complete and readable by the client app.

⸻

3. Check if useEffect is properly setting state

Make sure your match listener code actually sets state:

const [matches, setMatches] = useState<Match[]>([]);

useEffect(() => {
  const unsubscribe = listenToAllMatches((matchList) => {
    setMatches(matchList);
  });

  return () => unsubscribe();
}, []);

✅ Confirm the UI uses matches.map(...) and not some stale state or empty array.

⸻

4. Verify Match Filtering Logic in UI

Sometimes you’re filtering out matches unintentionally:

const visibleMatches = matches.filter(m => m.status === 'in-progress');

❌ This would hide all matches unless the status is exactly "in-progress".

✅ Temporarily remove filters to debug:

{matches.map((match) => (
  <div key={match.id}>{match.teamA} vs {match.teamB}</div>
))}



⸻

5. Check Firebase Read Permissions

Make sure your Firebase Realtime DB rules allow public read (for now):

{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}

If you’ve restricted access, the stat tracker may not be able to fetch anything.

✅ Try temporarily loosening rules to test.

⸻

✅ Quick Checklist:

Item	Check
Firebase has matches under /matches	✅
Stat tracking page is calling correct Firebase listener	✅
Listener is setting state (setMatches)	✅
UI is mapping over matches and not filtering incorrectly	✅
Firebase rules allow read	✅

📣 Next Step:

Would you like to:
	•	Share the code for the stat tracking page?
	•	Let me review the listener function (listenToMatches...)?
	•	Or confirm Firebase structure via screenshot?

I can help line-by-line once you send one of those. 👊
