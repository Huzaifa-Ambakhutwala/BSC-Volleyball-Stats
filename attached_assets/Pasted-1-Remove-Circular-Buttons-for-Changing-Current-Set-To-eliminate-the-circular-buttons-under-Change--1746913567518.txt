1. Remove Circular Buttons for Changing Current Set
To eliminate the circular buttons under "Change Current Set", simply remove the corresponding button code from the componentâ€™s render function. You would typically look for a section that has a button action related to changing the set and remove it.

2. Fix Error on Advancing to the Next Set
It seems the logic for transitioning between sets may need adjustments to ensure that it allows moving from one set to the next correctly. You might need to add a condition to ensure that the set you are finalizing is not already final.

3. Correct Handling After Finalizing Set 3
While on Set 3, instead of finalizing it, provide an option to "Submit Match". Make sure to check on your button for finalizing Set 3 and replace it with a submission button once the current set is complete.

Updated Code Snippets
Here are example code snippets for each of the points mentioned:

1. Remove Circular Buttons
Locate and remove any buttons like this:

<button onClick={handleAdvanceToNextSet}>
  <span>Advance to Next Set</span>
</button>
2. Fix Advancing Logic
Check the function that handles moving to the next set:

const handleAdvanceToNextSet = () => {
  if (currentSet >= 3) {
    toast({
      title: "Cannot advance",
      description: "Set 3 is the final set.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    return;
  }
  
  // Proceed with advancing logic
  setCurrentSet(currentSet + 1);
};
3. Update Finalizing Logic for Set 3
In the render method where you conditionally render buttons, adjust it as follows:

{currentSet === 3 ? (
  <button 
    className="bg-blue-600 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition"
    onClick={submitMatch}
  >
    Submit Match
  </button>
) : (
  <button 
    className="bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700"
    onClick={handleFinalizeSet}
  >
    Finalize Set {currentSet}
  </button>
)}

Subject: StatTrackerPage Improvements Request

Hello Team,

I would like to suggest a few improvements for the StatTrackerPage:

Remove the circular buttons under the "Change Current Set" section to streamline the interface.
Update the logic that handles advancing to the next set. Currently, when I try to finalize Set 1 and advance to Set 2, I encounter an error saying "Failed to advance to next set". Please ensure the logic correctly allows transitioning from one set to the next.
When I reach Set 3 and click "Finalize Set 3", it gives an error stating "Cannot advance, set 3 is the final set". Instead of finalizing set 3, there should be an option to "Submit Match" instead, locking all sets without allowing further edits.
Thank you for your attention to these enhancements!
